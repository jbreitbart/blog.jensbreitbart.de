Work is boring these days. It is strange. People often call me lucky that I have a job, but boy is it dull. Over the last years I applied for various jobs, but the contracts never were any good. It just now dawns on me why that was.

I used to be a well respected colleague. A guy people come to, when they were not sure how to solve a problem. These questions stopped, barely notable at first … but …  I must prepare for a meeting. And that one is important, I’ll be back later.

I still feel bad about it, but it convinced management. I’ve got the go for the new team member. He will join my team and that should noticeably reduce our error rate. I had to ace various of the new colleagues and Mark, who is working here almost as long as I have. Mark, Jon and I used to work together not only back in the old days, but we continued to support us even after the latest changes. We used to make sure that none of the new guys sneaks up on us and they were not able to get any of the new team members, but had to work with the old ones we dumped onto them. But that was before the accident that got Jon fired and his life ruined. That day started the rivalry between Mark and me.

Today is the day for the new team member to take over the work of the old one. Finally. The old one got unreliable. I just hope he get’s not dumped onto Mark, but on one of the new guys. I wish things were different.

Boy is that dull. Everything is working just as it should be and I am watching the new one as he is doing his job. Flawlessly. Error rate is expected to be at less than 0.00001% and the latest software is supposed to detect high risks scenarios so that catastrophic errors like the one that left Jon’s life in ruin will never happen again.  My job is merely a singularity by law, but I guess it is better than no job. I am an independent contractor with just one company using my service. I am liable for everything my team does, yet their sheer speed makes it impossible for me to interfere. But everyone should have a job.

„He“. I wonder why they requested us to not just call them what they are: robots. Use „it“.  And how they managed to make me use it even when nobody is listening.
