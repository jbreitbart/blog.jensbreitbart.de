Here I am. Running. Sweating. Concentrating on my step rate. I am sure it can be optimized further. I hear my heart rate increasing. I can feel my blood circulating. I must make it. I canâ€™t let go. I hear the crowd. I hear the whistle. I must be quick. I jumped. I got the train.

School sport really paid off today.
